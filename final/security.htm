	<p>YouTube is a video sharing network widely used around the world. It is used by billions of people. Most of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals who provide a good opportunity for hackers to spread viruses. The main reasons hackers hack are to gain money, make a point, or simply just for fun. Hackers will sometimes have very strong opinions towards people or groups and will hack into their systems just to aggravate them and waste their time. Others simply do it for the fun of it or to impress a couple of friends. The most common way viruses are spread on YouTube is through ads. Say you are watching a video when an ad for a chance to win a 42” flat screen TV catches your eye. You click on the ad but the link does not take you where you thought you were going. You have just welcomed the hackers into your system. Another common way viruses are spread throughout this site is banner ads. The only difference between them is their size and cost.
	<p>While normal ads cost money and look like this:</p>
	<div class="image center" style="width:274px; height:353px;">
		<img src="security-website-ad-space.png" width="271" height="350" alt="website-ad-space.png">
	</div>
	<p>Banner ads are free and will look like this:</p>
	<div class="image center" style="width:538px; height:210px;">
		<img src="security-banner_advertisement1.png" width="535" height="207" alt="banner_advertisement1.png">
	</div>
	<p>Since most of the content on YouTube is user uploaded, you will also need to be aware of links given in the videos pop-up boxes and the comments. They may not always lead you where they say they will.</p>
<h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
	<h4>1: Keep your browser up to date</h4>
		<p>An outdated browser will expose you to all sorts of threats such as identity theft, viruses, Trojans, spyware, adware, and other sorts of malware. Updating your browser will protect you from these for the most part and give you a better experience while online.</p>
	<h4>2: Use valid codecs</h4>
		<p>Codecs are computer programs that allow you to stream media on your computer. Media files, such as music or videos are very large; Codecs speed up the streaming process of your media file. The more commonly used codecs are MP3, WMA, RealVideo, RealAudio, DivX and XviD. Invalid codecs will expose your software to viruses.</p>
	<h4>3: Don’t click links in the videos or comments.</h4>
		<p>They may not lead where they say they are.</p>
	<h4>4: Install a plugin.</h4>
		<p>Installing a plugin will block malicious malware from infecting your computer. Plugins such as NoScript and Java are recommended.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is up to the user to make sure they are protecting themselves from people with malicious intents.</p>
