	<p>YouTube has had a dramatic impact worldwide, due to the international nature of the internet and how videos transcend language. People today use YouTube for purposes as diverse as learning and teaching material to publicly shaming people. YouTube is a platform where people are given the opportunity to freely share any (non-obscene) video that they please, casual or serious. This has had its benefits and downsides.</p>
	<p>YouTube is contending with TV and other media in spreading content, and has been labeled as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation">disruptive</a>. People can gain attention worldwide more efficiently with YouTube, which essentially transcends all country borders. Naturally, offensive content has also prompted websites to restrict access to YouTube. Videos insulting the king have resulted in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/business/worldbusiness/05tube.html">a restriction in Thailand</a>, for example, where it is against the law to offend or insult the king or an image of the king. Political videos have been found to have strong effects on poll results and negative videos spread through social media in the United States have led to a sort of public shaming, with politicians apologizing publicly or even resigning. Musicians on YouTube have had their popularity boom, such as PSY with Gangnam Style, and videos by gamers have also attracted large followings, such as video game commentator PewDiePie, who has the YouTube channel with the most views of all time.
	<p>YouTube also gives individuals the opportunity to make their own fame, such as with indie music. Combined with today's social media, links to videos can spread like wildfire throughout countries, accumulating views at a rapid rate.</p>
