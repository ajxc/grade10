easy A

Next great act: rebuke the TAs at my uni web design class for marking me down when I rejected abuse of `<strong>` in favour of `font-weight: bold`. Heavens, what did you learn from the anti-`<b>` articles?

The class teaching material was a relic from 1999 or something. It taught you about frames and encouraged you to not close paragraph tags.

Obviously this is not a result of that teaching material. I used frames anyway for the humor.

Everyone else's websites looked appropriately Netscape-chic, except for one bastard who used a premade Adobe Fireworks template, looking like it was from 2007 but still flashy enough that it won the class competition. Cheater. Mine was handwritten in Notepad, like everyone else.

This wasn't supposed to be a plagiarized collection of other people's recipes.

## [`uw`](https://ajxc.github.io/grade10/uw)

Probably because I powered through the 1999 web tutorial.

Don't touch this disaster. Please.
